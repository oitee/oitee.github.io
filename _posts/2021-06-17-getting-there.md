Now that Linux is ready, I needed to install VS Code so that I can save the programs I write in the days to come.

***Setting up VS Code***

‘Visual Studio Code’ is a ‘source-code editor’. This is where I will begin my journey of coding. It allows the user to type out lines of codes of various coding languages and to compile them to see if output of the same. I will start by learning javascript. I aim to start with *freeCodeCamp*'s [Basic JavaScript course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures#basic-javascript). 

***Going forward***

For the time-being this is my preliminary plan for my foray into Computer Science; it will will involve four parallel tracks:
- **CS Fundamentals** (6 weeks): This will involve learning about Computer Architecture, networking, compilers, OS-Unix, Databases etc
- **Programming** (Perpetual): Data structures, algorithms, classes of problems, Big O, functional and object-oriented programming
- **Tooling/Work-flow** (2 weeks): Linux, IDEs, searching for answers, Github, CLI tool, influential papers
- **Web Development** (6 weeks): Server-Client, HTTP/TCP, Scale, Components (CDN, Lambd, load balancers, DBS

Needless to say, I am very excited for what lies ahead. I am confident this will be worthwhile, and I will emerge as a coder on the other side.
