Hello! I am Oitihjya (Otee) and thank you for visiting! I am a qualified lawyer who is learning to code. I’d love to [hear from you](mailto:contact@otee.dev). 

- I have previously worked as a **Research Fellow** at India’s [leading legal think tank](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/team/oitihjya-sen/) (2019-21). As a Research Fellow, I have researched extensively on [modernizing India’s bankruptcy legal framework](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Report-on-Pre-Packaged-Insolvency-Resolution.pdf) and advised the Government of India on [implementing key bankruptcy reforms](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/blog/pre-packaged-insolvency-resolution-under-the-insolvency-and-bankruptcy-code-ibc-an-overview/).

- After having worked in the legal field for three years, I am currently switching to a new career in software engineering.

- I have worked on **five projects** so far: 
    - A [per-user URL shortener](https://oteetwirl.herokuapp.com/) ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oitee/twirl)),
    - A [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/cardimomT) that aggregates blog posts from RSS and Atom feeds and publishes them on Twitter ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oitee/cardimom)),  
    - A simple [Lisp interpreter](https://otee.dev/2021/08/24/crisp-a-simple-lisp-interpreter.html) ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oitee/crisp)), 
    - Implementation of [Search Relevance using BM25 algorithm](https://otee.dev/2021/11/24/search-relevance-using-bm-25.html) ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oitee/bm25)), and
    - This [blog](https://otee.dev/) ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oitee/oitee.github.io))


- As a self-learner, I follow the **Feynman Technique** of learning new concepts by writing about them in my own words. I have published over **30 posts** so far, documenting my understanding of various topics ranging from [higher-order functions](https://otee.dev/2021/07/11/higher-order-functions.html), [JavaScript Promises](https://otee.dev/2021/11/10/javascript-promises.html) to [cache replacement policies](https://otee.dev/2021/08/18/cache-replacement-policy.html).

- I love participating in spirited debates, discussing politics over Darjeeling Tea,  and listening to good old [RabindraSangeet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindra_Sangeet)!
