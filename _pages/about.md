Hello! I am Otee and thank you for visiting! I am a qualified lawyer who is learning to code! I’d love to [hear from you]((mailto:contact@otee.dev)). 


Here are a few things I'd _love_ to tell you more about over a hot cup of Darjeeling Tea:

- I am a graduate from India’s [National Law University](https://hnlu.ac.in/) and I have worked as a Research Fellow at India’s [leading legal think tank](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/team/oitihjya-sen/) since 2019.

- I am currently learning JavaScript and I write weekly about new concepts I learn. It has been an exciting journey and I aim to periodically write about my entire experience (the ups and **the downs**)!

- I’ve recently written a project that implements a [simple Lisp interpreter](https://github.com/oitee/crisp)! I would love to hear your suggestions on it!

- I love participating in spirited debates, discussing politics over coffee,  and listening to good old [RabindraSangeet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindra_Sangeet)!



To contact me, drop a mail to [contact@otee.dev](mailto:contact@otee.dev)! Also, here's my [Github profile](https://github.com/oitee).
