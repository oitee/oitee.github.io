<h1 align="center"> About</h1>

Hi, I am **Oitihjya Sen**. I am a qualified lawyer who is learning to code. 

I am attending the Winter '22 batch of the [**Recurse Center**](https://www.recurse.com/), New York.

I have previously worked as a [**Research Fellow**](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/team/oitihjya-sen/) at India’s [leading legal think tank](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/) (2019-21), where I contributed towards [modernizing India’s bankruptcy legal framework](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Report-on-Pre-Packaged-Insolvency-Resolution.pdf).

In the past six months, I have built **five projects**: 
- A [per-user URL shortener](https://oteetwirl.herokuapp.com/) ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oitee/twirl)),
- A [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/cardimomT) that aggregates blog posts from RSS and Atom feeds and publishes them on Twitter ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oitee/cardimom)),  
- A simple [Lisp interpreter](https://otee.dev/2021/08/24/crisp-a-simple-lisp-interpreter.html) ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oitee/crisp)), 
- Implementation of [Search Relevance using BM25 algorithm](https://otee.dev/2021/11/24/search-relevance-using-bm-25.html) ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oitee/bm25)), and
- This [blog](https://otee.dev/) ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oitee/oitee.github.io))

Following the **Feynman Technique**, I learn new concepts by writing about them in my own words. I have published over **35 posts** so far, documenting my understanding of various topics ranging from [OAuth framework](/2021/12/27/understanding-oauth.html), [higher-order functions](/2021/07/11/higher-order-functions.html), [JavaScript Promises](/2021/11/10/javascript-promises.html) to [cache replacement policies](/2021/08/18/cache-replacement-policy.html).

I love participating in spirited debates, discussing politics over Darjeeling Tea,  and listening to good old [RabindraSangeet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindra_Sangeet)!

To contact me, drop a mail to [contact@otee.dev](mailto:contact@otee.dev)! Also, here's my [Github profile](https://github.com/oitee).
