<h1 align="center"> About</h1>

Hi, I am **Oitihjya Sen**, a lawyer-turned programmer from India. 

I am currently working as a **Product Engineer** at [Shuru](https://www.shuruapp.com/), an ed-tech startup focussed on upskilling India's burgeoning youth.

Prior to joining Shuru, I attended the [**Recurse Center**](https://www.recurse.com/), New York, where I met some of the smartest and most curious programmers from across the globe.

In my erstwhile avatar as a lawyer, I worked as a [**Research Fellow**](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/team/oitihjya-sen/) at India’s [leading legal think tank](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/) (2019-21), where I contributed towards [modernizing India’s bankruptcy legal framework](https://vidhilegalpolicy.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Report-on-Pre-Packaged-Insolvency-Resolution.pdf).

Here are a few of my personal projects:  
- A [per-user URL shortener](https://twirl.otee.dev) ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oitee/twirl)),
- A [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/cardimomT) that aggregates blog posts from RSS and Atom feeds and publishes them on Twitter ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oitee/cardimom)),  
- A simple [Lisp interpreter](/2021/08/24/crisp-a-simple-lisp-interpreter.html) ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oitee/crisp)), 
- Implementation of [Search Relevance using BM25 algorithm](/2021/11/24/search-relevance-using-bm-25.html) ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oitee/bm25)), 
- A meeting scheduler that handles time-slot conflicts ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oitee/meetings)), and
- This [blog](https://otee.dev/) ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oitee/oitee.github.io))

I have written over **40 posts** on my tech blog, on various topics ranging from [OAuth framework](/2021/12/27/understanding-oauth.html), [higher-order functions](/2021/07/11/higher-order-functions.html), [JavaScript Promises](/2021/11/10/javascript-promises.html) to [cache replacement policies](/2021/08/18/cache-replacement-policy.html) and [lazy sequences in Clojure](/2022/01/17/lazy-clojure.html).

I love participating in spirited debates, discussing politics over Darjeeling Tea,  and listening to good old [RabindraSangeet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindra_Sangeet)!
